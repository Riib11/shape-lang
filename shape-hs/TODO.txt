Things the model needs to do:

- Apply a type change at an index in a term (recursive changes as a result)
- Get the "code" at an index (Copy)
    - needs term, type context
- Take a "code" and put it into a buffer (Paste)
    - needs to put into holes everything that isn't in context
- Get context for a term given an index
- Introduce new variable into buffer
    - (The neutral form with given variable on the left, and holes on right)
-
